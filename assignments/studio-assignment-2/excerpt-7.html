            Have not you yourselves sensed a <span class="invisible1">difference</span> in the light that suffuses such a room, a rare <span class="invisible1">tranquility</span> not found in ordinary light? Have you never felt a sort of <span class="invisible1">fear</span> in the face of the <span class="invisible1">ageless</span>, a fear that in that room you might lose all <span class="invisible1">consciousness</span> of the passage of time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you had grown old and gray?
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the <span class="invisible2">innermost rooms</span> of these huge buildings, to which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a <span class="invisible2">sliding door or screen</span> will pick up a distant <span class="invisible2">glimmer</span> from the garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, like the glow upon the <span class="invisible2">horizon</span> at sunset. In no other setting is gold quite so <span class="invisible2">exquisitely beautiful</span>. You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; and as you move away the golden surface of the paper glows ever <span class="invisible2">more deeply</span>, changing not in a flash, but growing slowly, steadily <span class="invisible2">brighter</span>, like color rising in the face of a giant. Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had <span class="invisible2">burst into flame</span>.
        </p>
        <p id="p3">
            How, in such a dark place, gold draws <span class="invisible3">so much light</span> to itself is a mystery to me. But I see why in ancient times <span class="invisible3">statues</span> of the Buddha were gilt with <span class="invisible3">gold</span> and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the <span class="invisible3">nobility</span>. Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not <span class="invisible3">merely captivated</span> by its beauty, they also knew its <span class="invisible3">practical value</span>; for gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a reflector. Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere <span class="invisible3">extravagance</span>. Its reflective properties were put to use as a source of <span class="invisible3">illumination</span>. Silver and other metals quickly lose their <span class="invisible3">gloss</span>, but gold retains its <span class="invisible3">brilliance</span> indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.
