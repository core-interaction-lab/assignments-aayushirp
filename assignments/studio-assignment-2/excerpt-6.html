                This was the genius of our ancestors, that by <span class="invisible1">cutting off the light</span> from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there a quality of <span class="invisible1">mystery and depth</span> superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no means so <span class="invisible1">simply achieved</span>. We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with each invisible detail-the <span class="invisible1">placement of the window</span> in the shelving recess, the <span class="invisible1">depth</span> of the crossbeam, the <span class="invisible1">height</span> of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale <span class="invisible1">white glow</span> of the shoji in the study bay; I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.

                The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window built to provide a <span class="invisible2">place for reading</span>. Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a <span class="invisible2">source of light</span> for the alcove; but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to <span class="invisible2">soften</span> the sidelong rays from without, to <span class="invisible2">filter</span> them through paper panels. There is a cold and <span class="invisible2">desolate</span> tinge to the light by the time it reaches these panels. The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves and through the corridors has by then <span class="invisible2">lost its power</span> to illuminate, seems drained of the <span class="invisible2">complexion</span> of life. It can do no more than accentuate the <span class="invisible2">whiteness</span> of the paper. I sometimes linger before these panels and study the <span class="invisible2">surface</span> of the paper, bright, but giving no impression of brilliance.
            </p>
            <p id="p3">
                In temple architecture the main room stands at a <span class="invisible3">considerable distance</span> from the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale, white glow <span class="invisible3">scarcely varies</span>. And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely <span class="invisible3">immobile</span>, as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper itself. I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike <span class="invisible3">luminescence</span>, feeling as though some misty film were blunting my <span class="invisible3">vision</span>. The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead <span class="invisible3">repelled by</span> the darkness, creating a world of <span class="invisible3">confusion</span> where dark and light are indistinguishable.
