                Core 2 Interaction Studio class’ second project - Stories As Networks' prompt was to choose a significant minimum 2000 word text to create an interactive, screen-based reading experience that communicates our interpretation of the chosen text.
                <br><br>
                I chose the text, In Praise of Shadows by Jun’ichiro Tanizaki, which is a 1933 book on Japanese aesthetics. The author talks about the foundations of Japanese aesthetic traditions, mainly mentioning how the Japanese embraced the shadows and darkness, especially in Japanese architecture. 
                <br><br>
                I have divided the excerpt into 8  chapters so that it is easier for the reader to navigate through the whole text. I wanted to focus on this concept of embracing the shadow, also including elements such as shoji doors and the concept of ‘wabi-sabi’ within my website.
