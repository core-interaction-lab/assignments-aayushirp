            <h2>Cross-Platform Storytelling is a project for Core 2: Interaction Studio's class at Parsons School of Design.</h2> 
            <br>
            <h3>We start off the project by critiquing and reimagining an existing interaction for a specific platform. The main goal of this project is to create a narrative through linking various online platforms.</h3>

            <h4>My idea is inspired by a true experience of attending university online for my first year! My prompt is based on the video-calling platform called <a class="zoom-link" href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> and how online learning could be way easier.
            The idea is based off of how during online lectures or even work meetings when there are no breaks, we need to use the bathroom or have some urgent task come up and need to tend to that but because we are in a meeting we eitehr leave the zoom or have to wait till it's over. 
            This made me realise why isn't there a feature like the 'reactions' button on any kind of video calling app? Thus, it gave me the idea to create a feature that allows users to highlight when they are away from the device doing some task or having issues, which would then reflect on their thumbnail as well letting other users know too!</h4>
