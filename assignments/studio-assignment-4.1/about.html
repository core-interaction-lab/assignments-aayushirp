            <div class="description">
                For this project, we had to create an interactive online tool and design this tool with a specific goal in mind plus for a specific audience. It would receive input from the user, and based on the input it receives, it provides an unique output.
                <br>
                I decided to create a visual and audio generator that are connected by a certain mood and are played when the user presses any of the alphabet keys on their keyboard. The user has to press and play around to remember which mood is which alphabet key and they can then leave it to play in the background while they are doing their task.
