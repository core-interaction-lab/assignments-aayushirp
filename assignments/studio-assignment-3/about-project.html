            This is an Elastic Collection project for Core Interaction 2 Studio class, where we had to create an online experience based of a database of a unique collection of 100 items made on airtable by one of our classmates. I have created my website based on Shruti Pathak's collection of various food items that are filtered by categories such as 'Cube Rule Type', 'Cuisine', 'Flavour', and 'Soup or Salad'. I wanted to plaay with these categories as most raise a debate about whether a food item is a certain thing or not. Thus, I wanted to showcase that with an interactive game in the beginning and then presenting the whole collection.
